    <h1>Chemical Composition of Wildfires</h1>

    <p>Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of gaseous pollutants, hazardous air pollutants, water vapor, and particulate matter.</p>

    <p>Particulate matter, also known as PM, is a term used to describe particles composed of solid and liquid matter that are suspended in the air. Wildfires are a common source of particulate matter. The exact composition of PM varies depending on the source.</p>
